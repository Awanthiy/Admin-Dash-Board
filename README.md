E-Dashboard
Welcome to eE-Dashboard, a sleek and fully responsive admin dashboard built with React and Tailwind CSS. This project gives you a smooth and modern interface to manage users, monitor insights, and tweak your settings — all in one place!

Features
Navigation Bar:
Easily switch between Dashboard, Users, Insights, and Settings tabs. The logo “E-dashboard” keeps the branding consistent.

Dashboard Page:
A warm welcome with your profile picture and name, plus quick stats cards showing total admins, total users, and active sessions. You also get a line chart to visualize user growth over time.

Users Page:
Manage all users with a searchable and filterable table. Filter by role or status (active users in green, inactive in red), and find users quickly by name.

Insights Page:
Dive into analytics with a bar graph showing user growth over the last six months, and a pie chart that breaks down user roles (admin, editor, user).

Settings Page:
Update your username and password, toggle email notifications, and save your preferences easily.
